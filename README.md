# Glucose Level Prediction â€“ Baseline ANN

This project is an earlier stage exploration of predicting future blood glucose levels using simple ANN architectures.  
It helped me build intuition about time-series modeling before moving on to more advanced architectures like LSTM, GRU, and CNN.

---

## Objective

The goal was to forecast a patient's future blood glucose readings based only on their previous measurements, working with minimal features to simulate wearable device data.

## My Learning Focus

- **Basic ANN Design**:  
  Built and trained baseline neural network models for time-series prediction tasks.
  
- **Experimenting with Parameters**:  
  Adjusted layer sizes, activation functions, and epochs to study the impact on predictions.

- **Learning Model Limitations**:  
  Observed that shallow models can work but may struggle with longer sequence dependencies, leading to exploring deeper architectures in later versions.
